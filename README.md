PacMan Exercise

This project was aimed at creating factories as well as making the objects move across the screen while recognizing the screen boundaries.

Next I plan to create a background for the page to resemble the actual pacman game a bit more and add some of the blobs they chase with their own factory funtion for creation.

To run this Repo:
1. Clone this repo
2. Run on your local machine
